# dynamic_loader
This plugin will allow a developer to dynamically load the change into the memory while developing a plugin of QGIS. i.e., no frequent plugin reloads while developing


For every code change, it will detect the code chang and reload that funtion in the memory, wwhich serves as a hot swapping for QGIS Plugin

Hope you'll like my work.
